# Change: Update Project README

## Why
The current README.md is the default Vite + React template boilerplate that doesn't describe the actual project (Pulikon - Instagram Follower Analysis tool). Users visiting the repository need to understand what the project does, how to use it, and how to contribute.

## What Changes
Replace the template README with a proper project README that includes:
- Project description and purpose
- Live demo link (GitHub Pages)
- Key features list
- Screenshots/usage instructions
- Local development setup
- Technology stack
- Deployment information
- Contributing guidelines
- License information

## Impact
- Affected specs: Not applicable (documentation change)
- Affected code: README.md
- Result: Clear project documentation for users and contributors

## Notes
The template README mentions ESLint configuration suggestions, but this project uses Biome instead of ESLint for linting and formatting, so those suggestions are not applicable.
